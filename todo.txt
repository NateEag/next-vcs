- Review gitless and consider integrating it into my git workflows. It looks
  like it might improve the git experience somewhat. https://gitless.com/

- Review askgit. It lets you use SQL to interact with a git repository's
  metadata, which I wouldn't have thought to try, but it is an interesting UX
  thought, and could certainly be useful.
