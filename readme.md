# Version Control Is Not A Solved Problem

As a programmer, version control is a fundamental part of how I approach my
daily work.

Git is my current default choice for the many things it gets right, but it has
many superficial flaws and some fundamental ones.

It is my belief that a significantly better version control system is possible.

I would like, therefore, to think about what such a VCS might look like.


## Other People's Thoughts

I am definitely not the first person to express the idea that the ideal VCS has
not yet been written. Here's one such expression, though I know I have seen
several others (TODO Find some of those others):

This chat between ESR and the author of monotone was interesting:

## VCSes I Have Used

Git, CVS, Subversion, Mercurial (rarely), CA SCM (it's horrible)


## VCSes I Am Vaguely Aware Of

monotone, darcs, bazaar, BitKeeper, Perforce, Fossil


## VCSes I Know Only The Names Of

A patch-based VCS a la darcs that might be interesting: https://pijul.org/
